# Mentor brief — ClimRR cross-modal benchmark

Last updated: 2026-09-09   Next meeting: 2026-09-10 (Thursday mentor one-on-one); group meeting Mondays

## Status in five lines

1. The ClimRR table you shared is in the project, unchanged, and pinned by a checksum — 62,834 rows, 275 columns, and every value is read as text so identifiers like GEOID keep their leading zeros.
2. Every column has been catalogued against the ClimRR data dictionary PDF, and each one is marked with how much that PDF actually says about it: **21 fully described, 143 partly, 28 named but unclear, 83 not in the PDF at all.**
3. Nothing has been guessed. Where the PDF is silent, contradictory, or blank, the column is recorded as open rather than filled in from a plausible pattern — that is the reason the "fully described" number is small.
4. **Blocked on you:** the 19 questions below. Most can only be answered by you or by the ClimRR authors, because the table was assembled before it reached us — and the first one asks whether a document exists that would answer several at once.
5. Next, once answers arrive: write each answer down with its date and source, mark the columns it settles, and finish the column dictionary. No analysis of the climate data starts until that is done.

## Questions for this meeting (priority order)

| # | Q-ID | Question (one sentence) | Why we need it | What it unblocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Q0 | **Is there any other authoritative material about this file we should have** — (a) a newer or more complete data dictionary than our 19-page PDF, (b) a document, script or ArcGIS project describing how `FullData.csv` was assembled from the ClimRR layers and the Census and socioeconomic sources, (c) a ClimRR web page or release note naming the data version and export date? | One such document could answer many of the questions below at once, and it is the kind of evidence we are allowed to treat as authoritative — an answer in conversation settles one question, a specification settles a family of them. | Potentially most of Q1–Q18. |
| 2 | Q1 | The column names start with prefixes — `tempmaxann`, `tempmin_seas`, `precipann`, `noprecip`, `windspeed`, `hdd`, `cdd` — so **which ClimRR variable does each prefix come from**? | The PDF describes each variable in its own table and names fields only by their ending (`hist`, `rcp45_midc`), never by the prefix, so we cannot tell which table a column belongs to. | 101 columns — the largest single unblock in the project. |
| 3 | Q7 | What are the 56 `precipdaily_*` columns, in what unit, and do `D` and `P` mean difference and percent change? | They are the largest family in the table and appear nowhere in the PDF. | 56 columns; any precipitation work at all. |
| 4 | Q8 | Do the FWI class columns hold the six fire-danger classes from the PDF, what does `NC` stand for, and are `FWI_Bins_*` and `FWIBins_*` the same thing at two aggregations? | 30 columns have no entry in the PDF; the text ones hold values like `High` and `Very High`. | 30 columns; the fire-weather pilot. |
| 5 | Q10 | Which Census vintage are `GEOID`, `TRACTCE`, `NAME_1` and `NAMELSAD` from, and what coordinate system are `X`/`Y` in? | The tract vintage decides every geographic join this project can make; a wrong vintage silently mismatches tracts. | 9 columns; all mapping and all aggregation. |
| 6 | Q11 | Which single column is the authoritative grid-cell key, and are `Crossmodel`, `Crossmodel_1` and `Crossmodel_12` the same identifier from three source layers? | They cannot be identical as stored — they are blank on 0, 22 and 83 rows respectively — so joining on the wrong one drops rows. | 8 columns; every join. |
| 7 | Q12 | Are `created_us`, `last_edite`, `Shape_STAr` and the rest GIS bookkeeping we can ignore, and in what units are the shape area and length? | We want to exclude them deliberately rather than by assumption. | 6 columns. |
| 8 | Q17 | For the 24 columns where one value repeats very often, is that value a real measurement or a "no data" code? | Treating a fill code as a measurement would corrupt any average we ever compute. A per-column answer is needed; a general rule will not do. | 24 columns; every summary statistic. |
| 9 | Q9 | What are the seven population and resilience columns, from which source, and **is `-9` in `Aggregate_Resilience_Indicator_` a no-data code**? | That column is `-9` on all 62,834 rows. We will not call it "missing" without you saying so. | 7 columns. |
| 10 | Q18 | When was this file exported, and from which ClimRR release? | We know when it was downloaded, not when it was made; the benchmark has to cite a data version. | Citability of the whole dataset. |
| 11 | Q2 | Six "consecutive days with no precipitation" fields are listed in the PDF with the description column left empty — what do they hold, and in days? | The PDF is blank there, so no amount of re-reading resolves it. | 6 columns. |
| 12 | Q3 | Two rows describing *minimum* temperature appear inside the *maximum* temperature table — is that a typo in the PDF? | If so, four columns are currently pointed at the wrong description. | 4 columns. |
| 13 | Q4 | All the winter rows for seasonal minimum temperature read "Annual Average – Historical" regardless of scenario, unlike spring, summer and autumn — is that a typo? | As written, the scenario of four columns is not established. | 4 columns. |
| 14 | Q5 | Is `rcp85_mid` in a column name the same as `RCP85_MIDC` in the PDF, and `rcp85_end` the same as `RCP85_ENDC`? | The file is inconsistent with itself here, not only with the PDF. | 12 columns. |
| 15 | Q6 | Are the truncated season names — `sprin`, `autum` — just shortened spellings of `spring` and `autumn`? | Probably yes, but we do not want to assume it. | 6 columns. |
| 16 | Q13 | What is a Fire Weather Index value's unit, and is the "seasonal value" the ensemble mean of the seasonal average daily FWI? | The PDF describes these columns without naming the quantity or its unit. | 20 columns. |
| 17 | Q14 | Are the heat-index values degrees Fahrenheit on the extended scale of Lu and Romps that the PDF cites? | No unit is stated; the observed values span roughly 27 to 107. | 10 columns. |
| 18 | Q15 | Are the degree-day columns computed against a 65 °F reference, in °F-degree-days? | The PDF says "usually 65°F" in its narrative but does not state it for these columns. | 6 columns. |
| 19 | Q16 | Do the blank cells mark grid cells a source layer simply does not cover — in particular the 6,938 rows (11% of the table) blank across all precipitation columns? | It decides whether a blank is "no coverage" or something meaningful. | Interpretation of every blank in the table. |

Full detail for any question, including the exact columns and the PDF line numbers, is in `docs/METADATA_QUESTIONS.md`.

**How this file is maintained.** After each meeting Kaiyuan pastes his notes — the answers as the mentor gave them, in the mentor's own words where possible — to the COORDINATOR. The EXECUTOR then makes one commit per meeting that updates three things together: this file (a new row in *Answers received*, a filled-in *Meeting log* entry, and a rewritten *Status in five lines*), `data/metadata/resolutions.yaml` (one record per answer, carrying the date, the source, the verbatim statement, and the columns it settles), and `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` (the decision to accept that answer). An answer that names no columns is still recorded — it just moves no column, and the file says so rather than guessing which columns were meant.
